## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Github Credit-Risk data to better understand:

1. How people purchase credit with regards to duration??
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. What Job Category takes a bigger credit amount?
4. What can we deduce from customer segmentation?

The main data file related to this course is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaravananJaichandar/Credit-Risk-Model/master/german_credit_data.csv).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is ome notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Findings<a name="find"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Affinity Propagation<a name="propagation"></a>

A deep insight into clustering with affinity propagation (the clustering technique used in section 4) can be fouund [here](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/clustering-algorithms) and the model variable explanation can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.html) as well.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Github User SaravananJaichandar for the data. Please feel free to use the code here as you would like!
